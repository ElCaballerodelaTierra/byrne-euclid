\problemNP{A}{ part}{of a straight line cannot be in the plane of reference and a part in a plane more elevated.}

For, if possible, let a part \drawUnitLine{AB} of the straight line \drawUnitLine{AB,BC} be in the plane of reference \drawPolygon{PQRS}, and a part \drawUnitLine{BC} be in a plane more elevated.

There will then be in \drawPolygon{PQRS} some straight line continuous with \drawUnitLine{AB} in a straight line. Let it be \drawUnitLine{BD}. 

Therefore \drawUnitLine{AB} is a common segment of the two straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB,BC} and \drawUnitLine{AB,BD}, which is impossible, inasmuch as, if we describe a circle \drawArc{BAC,BDC,BAD} with centre \drawPointL{B} and radius \drawUnitLine{AB}, then the diameters will cut off unequal circumferences \drawArc{BAC} and \drawArc{BAC,BDC} of the circle.

Therefore, a part of a straight line cannot be in the plane of reference and a part in a plane more elevated.

For let the two straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD} cut one another at the point \drawPointL{E}.

I say that \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD} are in one plane, and every triangle is in one plane.

Take the points \drawPointL{F} and \drawPointL{G} at random on \drawUnitLine{EC} and  \drawUnitLine{EB}, let \drawUnitLine{CB} and \drawUnitLine{FG} be joined, and let \drawUnitLine{FH} and \drawUnitLine{GK} be drawn across.

I say first that the triangle \drawLine{EB,BC,CE} lies in one plane.

For, if part of the triangle \drawLine{EB,BC,CE}, either \drawLine{FH,HC,CF} or \drawLine{GB,BK,KG}, is in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, then a part also of one of the straight lines \drawUnitLine{EC} or \drawUnitLine{EB} is in the plane of reference, and a part in another.

But, if the part \drawLine{FG,GB,BC,CF} of the triangle \drawLine{EB,BC,CE} is in the plane of reference, and the rest in another, then a part also of both the straight lines \drawUnitLine{EC} and \drawUnitLine{EB} is in the plane of reference and a part in another, which was proved absurd. \inprop[prop:XI.I]

Therefore the triangle \drawLine{EB,BC,CE} lies in one plane. 

But, in whatever plane the triangle \drawLine{EB,BC,CE} is, each of the straight lines \drawUnitLine{EC} and \drawUnitLine{EB} also is, and in whatever plane each of the straight lines \drawUnitLine{EC} and \drawUnitLine{EB} is, \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD} also are. \inprop[prop:XI.I]

Therefore the straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD} are in one plane; and every triangle is in one plane.

\problemNP{I}{f}{two planes cut one another, their common section is a straight line.}

For let the two planes \drawPolygon{DBA'''A'',DAA'B} and \drawPolygon{BC'''C''D,CDBC'} cut one another, and let the line \drawUnitLine{DB} be their common section.

I say that the line \drawUnitLine{DB} is a straight line.

For, if not, join the straight line

$\therefore$ \lineBED\ and \lineBFD\ are not straight lines.

Similarly we can prove that neither will there be any other straight line joined from \drawPointL{B} to \drawPointL{D} except \drawUnitLine{DB}, the common section of the planes \drawPolygon{DBA'''A'',DAA'B} and \drawPolygon{BC'''C''D,CDBC'}.

\problemNP{I}{f}{a straight line be set up at right angles to two straight lines which cut one another, at their common point of section, it will also be at right angles to the plane passing through them.}

For let a straight line \drawUnitLine{EF} be set up at right angles to the two straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD} at \drawPointL{E}, the point at which the lines cut one another.

I say that \drawUnitLine{EF} is also at right angles to the plane passing through \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD}.

Cut off \drawUnitLine{AE}, \drawUnitLine{EB}, \drawUnitLine{CE}, and \drawUnitLine{ED} equal to one another. Draw any straight line \drawUnitLine{GH} across through \drawPointL{E} at random. Join \drawUnitLine{AD} and \drawUnitLine{CB}, and join \drawUnitLine{FA}, \drawUnitLine{FG}, \drawUnitLine{FD}, \drawUnitLine{FC}, \drawUnitLine{FH}, and \drawUnitLine{FB} from a point \drawPointL{F} taken at random on \drawUnitLine{EF}. (\inpropL[prop:XI.II] \inpropN[prop:I.III])

Now, since the two straight lines \drawUnitLine{AE} and \drawUnitLine{ED} equal the two straight lines \drawUnitLine{CE} and \drawUnitLine{EB} and contain equal angles, therefore the base \drawUnitLine{AD} equals the base \drawUnitLine{CB}, and the triangle \drawLine{AE,ED,DA} equals the triangle \drawLine{EC,CB,BE}, so that $\drawAngle{GAE} = \drawAngle{HBE}$. (\inpropL[prop:I.XV] \inpropN[prop:I.IV])

But $\drawAngle{AEG} = \drawAngle{BEH}$, $\therefore$ \drawLine{AE,EG,GA} and \drawLine{BE,EH,HB} are two triangles which have two angles equal to two angles respectively, and one side equal to one side, namely that adjacent to the equal angles, that is to say, $\drawUnitLine{AE} = \drawUnitLine{EB}$. Therefore they also have the remaining sides equals to the remaining sides, that is, $\drawUnitLine{GE} = \drawUnitLine{EH}$, and $\drawUnitLine{AG} = \drawUnitLine{BH}$. (\inpropL[prop:I.XV] \inpropN[prop:I.XXVI])

And, since $\drawUnitLine{AE} = \drawUnitLine{EB}$, while \drawUnitLine{FE} is common and at right angles, therefore the base \drawUnitLine{FA} equals the base \drawUnitLine{FB}. 

For the same reason, $\drawUnitLine{FC} = \drawUnitLine{FD}$. \inprop[prop:I.IV]

And, since $\drawUnitLine{AD} = \drawUnitLine{CB}$, and $\drawUnitLine{FA} = \drawUnitLine{FB}$, the two sides \drawUnitLine{FA} and \drawUnitLine{AD} equal the two sides \drawUnitLine{FB} and \drawUnitLine{BC} respectively, and the base \drawUnitLine{FD} was proved equal to the the base \drawUnitLine{FC}, therefore the angle \drawAngle{FAD} also equals the angle \drawAngle{FBC}. \inprop[prop:I.VIII]

And since, again, \drawUnitLine{AG} was proved equal to \drawUnitLine{BH}, and further, $\drawUnitLine{FA} = \drawUnitLine{FB}$, the two sides \drawUnitLine{FA} and \drawUnitLine{AG} equal the two sides \drawUnitLine{FB} and \drawUnitLine{BH}, and the angle \drawAngle{FAG} was proved equal to the angle \drawAngle{HBF}, therefore the base $\drawUnitLine{FG} = \drawUnitLine{FH}$. \inprop[prop:I.IV]

Again, since \drawUnitLine{GE} was proved equal to \drawUnitLine{EH}, and \drawUnitLine{EF} is common, the two sides \drawUnitLine{GE} and \drawUnitLine{EF} equal the two sides \drawUnitLine{HE} and \drawUnitLine{EF}, and the base \drawUnitLine{FG} equals the base \drawUnitLine{FH}, $\therefore \drawAngle{GEF} = \drawAngle{HEF}$. \inprop[prop:I.VIII]

Therefore each of the angles \drawAngle{GEF} and \drawAngle{HEF} is right.

$\therefore$ \drawUnitLine{FE} is at right angles to \drawUnitLine{GH} drawn at random through \drawPointL{E}.

Similarly we can prove that \drawUnitLine{FE} also makes right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. 

But a straight line is at right angles to a plane when it makes right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in that same plane, therefore \drawUnitLine{FE} is at right angles to the plane of reference. \indef[def:XI.III]

But the plane of reference is the plane through the straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD}.

Therefore \drawUnitLine{FE} is at right angles to the plane through \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD}.

I say that \drawUnitLine{BC}, \drawUnitLine{BD}, and \drawUnitLine{BE} are in one plane. 

For suppose that they are not, but, if possible, let \drawUnitLine{BD} and \drawUnitLine{BE} be in the plane of reference \drawPolygon[middle][planeOfReference]{PnwPnePsePsw} and \drawUnitLine{BC} in one more elevated. Produce the plane \drawPolygon[middle][otherPlane]{AA'FB,BFA''A'''} through \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{BC}. \inprop[prop:XI.III]

\otherPlane\ intersects \planeOfReference\ in a straight line. Let the intersection be \drawUnitLine{BF}. Therefore the three straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{BC}, and \drawUnitLine{BF} are in one plane \otherPlane, namely that drawn through \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{BC}. 

Now, since \drawUnitLine{AB} is at right angles to each of the straight lines \drawUnitLine{BD} and \drawUnitLine{BE}, therefore \drawUnitLine{AB} is also at right angles to the plane \planeOfReference\ through \drawUnitLine{BD} and \drawUnitLine{BE}. \inprop[prop:XI.IV]

But the plane \planeOfReference\ through \drawUnitLine{BD} and \drawUnitLine{BE} is the plane of reference, therefore \drawUnitLine{AB} is at right angles to the plane of reference. 

Thus \drawUnitLine{AB} also makes right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and lie in the plane of reference. \indef[def:XI.III]

But \drawUnitLine{BF}, which is the plane of reference, meets it, therefore the angle \drawAngle{FBA} is right. And, by hypothesis, the angle \drawAngle{ABC} is also right, therefore the angle $\drawAngle{FBA} = \drawAngle{ABC}$, and they lie in one plane, which is impossible.

Therefore the straight line \drawUnitLine{BC} is not in a more elevated plane. Therefore the three straight lines \drawUnitLine{BC}, \drawUnitLine{BD}, and \drawUnitLine{BE} are in one plane.

For let the two straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD} be at right angles to the plane of reference \drawPolygon[middle][planeOfReference]{PnwPnePsePsw}.

I say that $\drawUnitLine{AB} \parallel \drawUnitLine{CD}$.

Let them meet the plane of reference \planeOfReference\ at the points \drawPointL{B} and \drawPointL{D}. 

Join the straight line \drawUnitLine{BD}. Draw \drawUnitLine{DE} in \planeOfReference $\perp \drawUnitLine{BD}$, and make $\drawUnitLine{DE} = \drawUnitLine{AB}$. (\inpropL[prop:I.XI], \inpropL[prop:I.III])

Now, since \drawUnitLine{AB} is at right angles to \planeOfReference, it also makes right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and lie in the plane of reference.  \indef[def:XI.III]

But each of the straight lines \drawUnitLine{BD} and \drawUnitLine{BE} lies in \planeOfReference\ and meets \drawUnitLine{AB}, therefore each of the angles \drawAngle{ABD} and \drawAngle{ABE} is right. For the same reason each of the angles \drawAngle{CDB} and  \drawAngle{CDE} is also right. 

And since in \drawLine{AD,DB,BA} and \drawLine{DE,EB,BD} $\drawUnitLine{AB} = \drawUnitLine{DE}$, and \drawUnitLine{BD} is common, therefore the two sides \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{BD} equal the two sides \drawUnitLine{ED} and \drawUnitLine{DB}. And they include right angles \drawAngle{ABD} and \drawAngle{BDE}, therefore the base $\drawUnitLine{AD} = \drawUnitLine{BE}$. \inprop[prop:I.IV]

But the angle \drawAngle{ABE} is right, therefore the angle \drawAngle{EDA} is also right. Therefore \drawUnitLine{ED} is at right angles to \drawUnitLine{DA}. 

But it is also at right angles to each of the straight lines \drawUnitLine{BD} and \drawUnitLine{DC}, therefore \drawUnitLine{ED} is set up at right angles to the three straight lines \drawUnitLine{BD}, \drawUnitLine{DA}, and \drawUnitLine{DC} at their intersection. Therefore the three straight lines \drawUnitLine{BD}, \drawUnitLine{DA}, and \drawUnitLine{DC} lie in one plane. \inprop[prop:XI.V]

But in whatever plane \drawUnitLine{DB} and \drawUnitLine{DA} lie, \drawUnitLine{AB} also lies, for every triangle lies in one plane. \inprop[prop:XI.II]

Therefore the straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{BD}, and \drawUnitLine{DC} are in one plane. And each of the angles \drawAngle{ABD} and \drawAngle{BDC} is right, therefore \drawUnitLine{AB} is parallel to \drawUnitLine{CD}. \inprop[prop:I.XXVIII]

\problemNP{I}{f}{two straight lines are parallel and points be taken at random on each of them, the straight line joining the points is in the same plane with the parallel straight lines.}

Let \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD} be two parallel straight lines, and let points \drawPointL{E} and \drawPointL{F} be taken at random on them respectively.

I say that the straight line joining the points \drawPointL{E} and \drawPointL{F} lies in the same plane \drawPolygon[middle][planeOfReference]{PnwPnePsePsw} with the parallel straight lines.

For suppose it is not, but, if possible, let it be in a more elevated plane. Draw a plane \drawPolygon[middle][planeEGF]{EFF'E',EFF''E''} through \drawFromCurrentPicture[middle][lineEGF]{

}. Its intersection with the plane of reference is a straight line. Let it be \drawUnitLine{EF}. \inprop[prop:XI.III]

$\therefore$ the two straight lines \lineEGF\ and \drawUnitLine{EF} enclose an area, which is impossible. $\therefore$ the straight line joined from \drawPointL{E} to \drawPointL{F} is not in a plane more elevated. $\therefore$ the straight line joined from \drawPointL{E} to \drawPointL{F} lies in the plane through the parallel straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD}.

$\therefore$, if two straight lines are parallel and points are taken at random on each of them, then the straight line joining the points is in the same plane with the parallel straight lines.

\problemNP{I}{f}{two straight lines be parallel, and one of them be at right angles to any plane, then the remaining one will also be at right angles to the same plane.}

Let \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD} be two parallel straight lines, and let one of them, \drawUnitLine{AB}, be at right angles to the plane of reference \drawPolygon[middle][planeOfReference]{PnwPnePsePsw}.

I say that the remaining one, \drawUnitLine{CD}, is also at right angles to the same plane.

Let \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD} meet the plane of reference at the points \drawPointL{B} and \drawPointL{D}. Join \drawUnitLine{BD}. Then \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{CD}, and \drawUnitLine{BD} lie in one plane. \inprop[prop:XI.VII]

Draw \drawUnitLine{DE} in \planeOfReference\ $\perp \drawUnitLine{BD}$, make $\drawUnitLine{DE} = \drawUnitLine{AB}$, and join \drawUnitLine{BE}, \drawUnitLine{AE}, and \drawUnitLine{AD}. (\inpropL[prop:I.XI], \inpropL[I.III])

Now, since $\drawUnitLine{AB} \perp \planeOfReference$, therefore \drawUnitLine{AB} is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and lie in \planeOfReference. Therefore each of the angles \drawAngle{ABD} and \drawAngle{ABE} is right. \indef[def:XI.III]

And, since the straight line \drawUnitLine{BD} falls on the parallels \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{CD}, $\therefore \drawAngle{ABD} + \drawAngle{CDB} \drawTwoRightAngles$.

But the angle \drawAngle{ABD} is right, therefore the angle \drawAngle{CDB} is also right. $\therefore \drawUnitLine{CD} \perp \drawUnitLine{BD}$. \inprop[prop:I.XXIX]

And since in \drawLine{AD,DB,BA} and \drawLine{DE,EB,BD} $\drawUnitLine{AB} = \drawUnitLine{DE}$, and \drawUnitLine{BD} is common, the two sides \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{BD} equal the two sides \drawUnitLine{ED} and \drawUnitLine{DB}, and  $\drawAngle{ABD} = \drawAngle{EDB}$, for each is right, therefore the base $\drawUnitLine{AD} = \drawUnitLine{BE}$. \inprop[prop:I.IV]

And since in \drawLine{DE,EB,BD} and \drawLine{ED,DA,AE}$\drawUnitLine{AB} = \drawUnitLine{DE}$, and $\drawUnitLine{BE} = \drawUnitLine{AD}$, the two sides \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{BE} equal the two sides \drawUnitLine{ED} and \drawUnitLine{DA} respectively, and \drawUnitLine{AE} is their common base, $\therefore \drawAngle{ABE} = \drawAngle{EDA}$. \inprop[prop:I.VIII]

But the angle \drawAngle{ABE} is right, therefore the angle \drawAngle{EDA} is also right. $\therefore \drawUnitLine{ED} \perp \drawUnitLine{AD}$. But it is also $\perp \drawUnitLine{DB}$. $\therefore$ \drawUnitLine{ED} is also at right angles to the plane through \drawUnitLine{BD} and \drawUnitLine{DA}. \inprop[prop:XI.IV]

$\therefore$ \drawUnitLine{ED} also makes right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and lie in the plane through \drawUnitLine{BD} and \drawUnitLine{DA}. But \drawUnitLine{DC} lies in the plane \drawPolygon{BDC'A'} through \drawUnitLine{BD} and \drawUnitLine{DA} inasmuch as \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{BD} lie in the plane \drawPolygon{BDC'A'} through \drawUnitLine{BD} and \drawUnitLine{DA}, and \drawUnitLine{DC} also lies in the plane \drawPolygon{BDC'A'} in which \drawUnitLine{AB} and \drawUnitLine{BD} lie.

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{ED} \perp \drawUnitLine{DC}$, so that $\drawUnitLine{CD} \perp \drawUnitLine{DE}$. But $\drawUnitLine{CD} \perp \drawUnitLine{BD}$. $\therefore$ \drawUnitLine{CD} is set up at right angles to the two straight lines \drawUnitLine{DE} and \drawUnitLine{DB} so that \drawUnitLine{CD} is also at right angles to the plane through \drawUnitLine{DE} and \drawUnitLine{DB}. \inprop[prop:XI.IV]

But the plane through \drawUnitLine{DE} and \drawUnitLine{DB} is the plane of reference \planeOfReference, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{CD} \perp \planeOfReference$.

Therefore, if two straight lines are parallel, and one of them is at right angles to any plane, then the remaining one is also at right angles to the same

But, if a straight line be set up at right angles to two straight lines which cut one another, at the point of section, it will also be at right angles to the plane through them. \inprop[prop:XI.IV]

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{AF} \perp \drawPolygon{refPlane}$.

Therefore from the given elevated point \drawPointL{A} the straight line \drawUnitLine{AF} has been drawn perpendicular to the plane of reference \drawPolygon{refPlane}.

Let the plane of reference be the given plane \drawPolygon{refPlane}, and \drawPointL{A} the point in it. Thus it is required to set up from \drawPointL{A} a straight line at right angles to the \drawPolygon{refPlane}.

It will then make, as section through \drawPointL{A} in \drawPolygon{refPlane}, a straight line. \inprop[prop:XI.III]

Let it make \drawUnitLine{DA,AE}; therefore the straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB},
\drawUnitLine{AC}, \drawUnitLine{DA,AE} are in one plane \drawPolygon{planeABC}.

And, since $\drawUnitLine{CA} \perp \drawPolygon{refPlane}$, it will also make right angles with all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. \indef[def:XI.III]

But \drawUnitLine{DA,AE} meets it and is in \drawPolygon{refPlane}; therefore the angle \drawAngle{CAE} is right.

\problemNP{I}{f}{two straight lines be cut by parallel planes, they will be cut in the same ratios.}

For let any straight line \drawUnitLine{AB} be at right angles to the
plane of reference \drawPolygon{refPlane}.

I say that all the planes through \drawUnitLine{AB} are also at right angles to \drawPolygon{refPlane}.

For let \drawPolygon{planeDE} be drawn through \drawUnitLine{AB}, let \drawUnitLine{CE} be the common section of \drawPolygon{planeDE} and \drawPolygon{refPlane}. 

Let a point \drawPointL{F} be taken at random on \drawUnitLine{CE}, and from \drawPointL{F} let $\drawUnitLine{FG} \perp \drawUnitLine{CE}$ be drawn in \drawPolygon{planeDE}. \inprop[prop:I.XI]

Now, since $\drawUnitLine{AB} \perp \drawPolygon{refPlane}$, \drawUnitLine{AB}  is also at right angles to all the straight lines which meet it and are in the plane of reference. \indef[def:XI.III] So that it is also at right angles to \drawUnitLine{CE};
$\therefore \drawAngle{ABE} = \drawRightAngle$.

But $\drawAngle{GFB} = \drawRightAngle$, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{AB} \parallel \drawUnitLine{FG}$. \inprop[prop:I.XXVIII]

But $\drawUnitLine{AB} \perp \drawPolygon{refPlane}$, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{FG} \perp \drawPolygon{refPlane}$. \inprop[prop:XI.VIII]

Now a plane is at right angles to a plane, when the straight lines drawn, in one of the planes, at right angles to the common section of the planes are at right angles to the remaining plane. \indef[def:XI.IV]

And \drawUnitLine{FG}, drawn in one of the planes \drawPolygon{planeDE} at right angles to \drawUnitLine{CE}, the common section of the planes, was proved to be
at right angles to \drawPolygon{refPlane}. $\therefore \drawPolygon{planeDE} \perp  \drawPolygon{refPlane}$.

Similarly also it can be proved that all the planes through \drawUnitLine{AB} are at right angles to the plane of reference.

\problemNP{I}{f}{a solid angle be contained by three plane angles, any two, taken together in any manner, are greater than the remaining one.}

For let the solid angle at \drawFromCurrentPicture[middle][angleA]{
startAutoLabeling;
draw byNamedSolidAngle(A);
stopAutoLabeling;
}
be contained by the three plane angles \drawAngle{BAC}, \drawAngle{CAD}, \drawAngle{DAB}.

I say that any two of the angles \drawAngle{BAC}, \drawAngle{CAD}, \drawAngle{DAB}, taken together in any manner, are greater than the remaining one.

If now $\drawAngle{BAC} = \drawAngle{CAD} = \drawAngle{DAB}$, it is manifest that any two are greater than the remaining one.

But, if not, let \drawAngle{BAC} be greater, and on the straight line \drawUnitLine{AB}, and at the point \drawPointL{A} on it, let the angle \drawAngle{BAE} be constructed, in the plane \drawPolygon{planeBAC}, equal to the angle \drawAngle{DAB}.

Let \drawUnitLine{AE} be made equal to \drawUnitLine{AD}, and let \drawUnitLine{BE,EC}, drawn across through the point \drawPointL{E}, cut the straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{AC} at the points \drawPointL{B}, \drawPointL{C}; let \drawUnitLine{DB}, \drawUnitLine{DC} be joined.

Now, since in \drawLine{BD,DA,AB} and \drawLine{AE,EB,BA} $\drawUnitLine{DA} = \drawUnitLine{AE}$, and \drawUnitLine{AB} is common, two sides are equal to two sides; and $\drawAngle{DAB} = \drawAngle{BAE}$, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{DB} = \drawUnitLine{BE}$. \inprop[prop:I.IV]

And, since in \drawLine{BD,DC,CB} the two sides \drawUnitLine{BD}, \drawUnitLine{DC} are greater than \drawUnitLine{BC} \inprop[prop:I.XX], and of these \drawUnitLine{DB} was proved equal to \drawUnitLine{BE}, therefore the remainder \drawUnitLine{DC} is greater than the remainder \drawUnitLine{EC}.

Now, since in \drawLine{DC,CA,AD} and \drawLine{AC,CE,EA} $\drawUnitLine{DA} = \drawUnitLine{AE}$, and \drawUnitLine{AC} is common, and the base \drawUnitLine{DC} is greater than the base \drawUnitLine{EC}, $\therefore \drawAngle{DAC} > \drawAngle{EAC}$. \inprop[prop:I.XXV]

But $\drawAngle{DAB} = \drawAngle{BAE}$, $\therefore$ \drawAngle{DAB}, \drawAngle{DAC} are greater than \drawAngle{BAC}.

Similarly we can prove that the remaining angles also, taken together two and two, are greater than the remaining one.

} be a solid angle contained by the plane angles \drawAngle{BAC}, \drawAngle{CAD}, \drawAngle{DAB}.

I say that the angles \drawAngle{BAC}, \drawAngle{CAD}, \drawAngle{DAB} are less than four right angles.

For let points \drawPointL{B}, \drawPointL{C}, \drawPointL{D} be taken at random on the straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{AC}, \drawUnitLine{AD} respectively, and let \drawUnitLine{BC}, \drawUnitLine{CD}, \drawUnitLine{DB} be joined.

Now, since the solid angle at \drawFromCurrentPicture[middle][angleB]{
startAutoLabeling;
draw byNamedSolidAngle(CBA,ABD,CBD);
stopAutoLabeling;
} is contained by the three plane angles \drawAngle{CBA}, \drawAngle{ABD}, \drawAngle{CBD}, any two are greater than the remaining one. \inprop[prop:XI.XX]

For the same reason $\drawAngle{BCA} + \drawAngle{ACD} > \drawAngle{BCD}$, and $\drawAngle{CDA} + \drawAngle{ADB} > \drawAngle{CDB}$.

Therefore the six angles $\drawAngle{CBA} + \drawAngle{ABD} + \drawAngle{BCA}, \drawAngle{ACD} + \drawAngle{CDA} +  \drawAngle{ADB} > \drawAngle{CBD} + \drawAngle{BCD} + \drawAngle{CDB}$.

But $\drawAngle{CBD} + \drawAngle{BDC} + \drawAngle{BCD} = \drawTwoRightAngles$. \inprop[prop:I.XXXII]

$\therefore \drawAngle{CBA} + \drawAngle{ABD} + \drawAngle{BCA}, \drawAngle{ACD} + \drawAngle{CDA} +  \drawAngle{ADB} > \drawTwoRightAngles$.

And, since the three angles of each of the triangles \drawLine{AB,BC,CA},  \drawLine{AC,CD,DA},  \drawLine{AD,DB,BA} are equal to two right angles,
$\therefore \drawAngle{CBA} + \drawAngle{ACB} + \drawAngle{BAC} + \drawAngle{ACD} + \drawAngle{CDA} + \drawAngle{CAD} + \drawAngle{ADB} + \drawAngle{DBA} + \drawAngle{BAD} = 3\drawTwoRightAngles$.

And $\drawAngle{ABC} + \drawAngle{BCA} + \drawAngle{ACD} + \drawAngle{CDA} + \drawAngle{ADB} + \drawAngle{DBA} > \drawTwoRightAngles$.

Therefore the remaining three angles \drawAngle{BAC}, \drawAngle{CAD}, \drawAngle{DAB} containing the solid angle \angleA\ are less than four right angles.

Let \drawLine{LM,MN,NL} be so constructed that $\drawUnitLine{AC}=\drawUnitLine{LM}$, $\drawUnitLine{DF} = \drawUnitLine{MN}$, and further $\drawUnitLine{GK} = \drawUnitLine{NL}$, let the circle \drawCircle{LMN} be described about the triangle \drawLine{LM,MN,NL} , let its centre be taken, and let it be \drawPointL{O}; let \drawUnitLine{LO}, \drawUnitLine{MO}, \drawUnitLine{NO} be joined. I say that $\drawUnitLine{AB} > \drawUnitLine{LO}$.

For, if not, \drawUnitLine{AB} is either equal to \drawUnitLine{LO}, or less.

First, let $\drawUnitLine{AB} = \drawUnitLine{LO}$. Then, since $\drawUnitLine{AB} = \drawUnitLine{BC}$, and $\drawUnitLine{OL} = \drawUnitLine{OM}$, the two sides \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{BC} are equal to the two sides \drawUnitLine{LO}, \drawUnitLine{OM} respectively. And, by hypothesis, $\drawUnitLine{AC} =\drawUnitLine{LM}$. $\therefore \drawAngle{ABC} = \drawAngle{LOM}$. \inprop[prop:I.VIII]

For the same reason $\drawAngle{DEF} = \drawAngle{MON}$, and further $\drawAngle{GHK} = \drawAngle{NOL}$. $\therefore$ the three angles \drawAngle{ABC}, \drawAngle{DEF}, \drawAngle{GHK} are equal to the three angles \drawAngle{LOM}, \drawAngle{MON}, \drawAngle{NOL}.

But $\drawAngle{LOM} + \drawAngle{MON} + \drawAngle{NOL} = 4\drawRightAngle$. $\therefore \drawAngle{ABC} + \drawAngle{DEF} + \drawAngle{GHK} = 4\drawRightAngle$.

But they are also, by hypothesis, $< 4\drawRightAngle$: which is absurd.

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{AB} \neq \drawUnitLine{LO}$.

I say next that neither is \drawUnitLine{AB} less than \drawUnitLine{LO}. For, if possible, let it be so, and let \drawUnitLine{OP} be made equal to \drawUnitLine{AB}, and \drawUnitLine{OQ} equal to \drawUnitLine{BC}, and let \drawUnitLine{PQ} be joined.

Then, since $\drawUnitLine{AB} = \drawUnitLine{BC}$, $\drawUnitLine{OP} = \drawUnitLine{OQ}$, so that the remainder \drawUnitLine{LP} is equal to \drawUnitLine{QM}.

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{LM} \parallel \drawUnitLine{PQ}$ \inprop[prop:VI.II], and \drawLine{LM,MO,OL} is equiangular with \drawLine{PQ,QO,OP} \inprop[prop:I.XXIX]. $\therefore \drawUnitLine{OL}:\drawUnitLine{LM}::\drawUnitLine{OP}::\drawUnitLine{PQ}$ \inprop[prop:VI.IV]. And alternately, $\drawUnitLine{LO}:\drawUnitLine{OP}::\drawUnitLine{LM}::\drawUnitLine{PQ}$ \inprop[prop:V.XVI].

But $\drawUnitLine{LO} > \drawUnitLine{OP}$, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{LM} > \drawUnitLine{PQ}$.

But $\drawUnitLine{LM} = \drawUnitLine{AC}$(\conststr), $\therefore \drawUnitLine{AC} > \drawUnitLine{PQ}$.

Since, then, the two sides \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{BC} are equal to the two sides \drawUnitLine{PO}, \drawUnitLine{OQ}, and the base \drawUnitLine{AC} is greater than the base \drawUnitLine{PQ}, $\therefore \drawAngle{ABC} > \drawAngle{QOP}$. \inprop[prop:I.XXV]

Similarly we can prove that $\drawAngle{DEF} > \drawAngle{MON}$, and $\drawAngle{GHK} > \drawAngle{NOL}$.

$\therefore \drawAngle{ABC} + \drawAngle{DEF} + \drawAngle{GHK} > \drawAngle{LOM} + \drawAngle{MON} + \drawAngle{NOL}$.

But, by hypothesis, $\drawAngle{ABC} + \drawAngle{DEF} + \drawAngle{GHK} < 4\drawRightAngle$, $\therefore \drawAngle{LOM} + \drawAngle{MON} + \drawAngle{NOL}$ are much less than $4\drawRightAngle$.

But they are also $= 4\drawRightAngle$: which is absurd.

Therefore $\drawUnitLine{AB} \nless \drawUnitLine{LO}$. And it was proved that $\drawUnitLine{AB} \neq \drawUnitLine{LO}$, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{AB} > \drawUnitLine{LO}$.

Let then \drawUnitLine{OR} be set up from \drawPointL{O} at right angles to the plane of \drawCircle{LMN} \inprop[prop:XI.XII]. And let $\drawUnitLine{OR}^2 =\drawUnitLine{AB}^2 - \drawUnitLine{LO}^2$ (Lemma). Let \drawUnitLine{RL}, \drawUnitLine{RM}, \drawUnitLine{RN} be joined.

Then, since \drawUnitLine{RO} is at right angles to the plane of \drawCircle{LMN}, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{RO} \perp \drawUnitLine{LO}, \drawUnitLine{MO}, \drawUnitLine{NO}$.

And, since $\drawUnitLine{LO} = \drawUnitLine{OM}$, while \drawUnitLine{OR} is common and at right angles, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{RL} = \drawUnitLine{RM}$. \inprop[prop:I.IV]

For the same reason $\drawUnitLine{RN} = \drawUnitLine{RL} = \drawUnitLine{RM}$.

Next, since by hypothesis $\drawUnitLine{OR}^2 = \drawUnitLine{AB}^2 - \drawUnitLine{LO}^2$, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{AB}^2 = \drawUnitLine{LO}^2, \drawUnitLine{OR}^2$.

But $\drawUnitLine{LR}^2 = \drawUnitLine{LO}^2, \drawUnitLine{OR}^2$, for $\drawAngle{LOR} = \drawRightAngle$ \inprop[prop:I.XLVII]. $\therefore \drawUnitLine{AB}^2 = \drawUnitLine{RL}^2$, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{AB} = \drawUnitLine{RL}$.

But each of the straight lines \drawUnitLine{BC}, \drawUnitLine{DE}, \drawUnitLine{EF}, \drawUnitLine{GH}, \drawUnitLine{HK} is equal to \drawUnitLine{AB}, while each of the straight lines \drawUnitLine{RM}, \drawUnitLine{RN} is equal to \drawUnitLine{RL}. $\therefore$ each of the straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{BC}, \drawUnitLine{DE}, \drawUnitLine{EF}, \drawUnitLine{GH}, \drawUnitLine{HK} is equal to each of the straight lines \drawUnitLine{RL}, \drawUnitLine{RM}, \drawUnitLine{RN}.

And, since the two sides \drawUnitLine{LR}, \drawUnitLine{RM} are equal to the two sides \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{BC}, and the base \drawUnitLine{LM} is by hypothesis equal to the base \drawUnitLine{AC}, $\therefore \drawAngle{LRM} = \drawAngle{ABC}$. \inprop[prop:I.VIII]

For the same reason $\drawAngle{MRN} = \drawAngle{DEF}$ and $\drawAngle{LRN} = \drawAngle{GHK}$.

$\therefore$, out of the three plane angles \drawAngle{LRM}, \drawAngle{MRN}, \drawAngle{LRN}, which are equal to the three given angles \drawAngle{ABC}, \drawAngle{DEF}, \drawAngle{GHK}, the solid angle
\drawFromCurrentPicture[middle][angleA]{

at \drawPointL{R} has been constructed, which is contained by the angles \drawAngle{LRM}, \drawAngle{MRN}, \drawAngle{LRN}.

But how it is possible to take the square on \drawUnitLine{OR} equal to that area by which the square on \drawUnitLine{AB} is greater than the square on \drawUnitLine{LO}, we can show as follows.

Let the straight lines  \drawUnitLine{AB},  \drawUnitLine{LO} be set out, and let  \drawUnitLine{AB} be the greater.

Let the semicircle \drawArc{O} be described on \drawUnitLine{A'B'}, and into \drawArc{O} let \drawUnitLine{A'C'} be fitted equal to \drawUnitLine{LO}, not being greater than the diameter \drawUnitLine{A'B'} \inprop[prop:IV.I]. Let \drawUnitLine{C'B'} be joined.

Since then the angle \drawAngle{A'C'B'} is an angle in the semicircle \drawArc{O}, $\therefore \drawAngle{A'C'B'} = \drawRightAngle$. \inprop[prop:III.XXXI]

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{A'B'}^2 = \drawUnitLine{A'C'}^2 + \drawUnitLine{C'B'}^2$. \inprop[prop:I.XLVII]

Hence $\drawUnitLine{A'B'}^2 - \drawUnitLine{C'B'}^2 = \drawUnitLine{A'C'}^2$.

But $\drawUnitLine{A'C'} =\drawUnitLine{LO}$.

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{A'B'}^2 - \drawUnitLine{C'B'}^2 = \drawUnitLine{LO}^2$.

If then we cut off \drawUnitLine{OR} equal to \drawUnitLine{BC}, the square on \drawUnitLine{AB} will be greater than the square on \drawUnitLine{LO} by the square on \drawUnitLine{OR}.

\problemNP{I}{f}{a solid be contained by parallel planes, the opposite planes in it are equal and parallelogrammic.}

For let the solid \drawPolygon[middle][theSolid]{ABCD,BHFC,DCFE} be contained by the parallel planes
\drawLine[middle][planeAC]{AB,BC,CD,DA}, \drawLine[middle][planeGF]{GH,HF,FE,EG}, \drawLine[middle][planeAH]{AB,BH,HG,GA}, \drawLine[middle][planeDF]{DC,CF,FE,ED}, \drawLine[middle][planeBF]{BH,HF,FC,CB}, \drawLine[middle][planeAE]{AG,GE,ED,DA}. I say that the opposite planes in it are equal and parallelogrammic.

For, since the two parallel planes \planeAH, \planeDF\ are cut by the plane \planeAC,
their common sections are parallel. \inprop[prop:XI.XVI]

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{AB} \parallel \drawUnitLine{DC}$.

Again, since the two parallel planes \planeBF, \planeAE\ are cut by the plane \planeAC, their common sections are parallel. \inprop[prop:XI.XVI]

$\therefore \drawUnitLine{BC} \parallel \drawUnitLine{AD}$.

But $\drawUnitLine{AB} \parallel \drawUnitLine{DC}$, $\therefore$ \planeAC\ is a parallelogram.

Similarly we can prove that each of the planes \planeDF, \planeGF, \planeAH, \planeBF, \planeAE is a parallelogram.

Let \drawUnitLine{AH}, \drawUnitLine{DF} be joined.

Then, since $\drawUnitLine{AB} \parallel \drawUnitLine{DC}$, and $\drawUnitLine{BH} \parallel \drawUnitLine{CF}$, the two straight lines \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{BH} which meet one another are parallel to the two straight lines \drawUnitLine{DC}, \drawUnitLine{CF} which meet one
another, not in the same plane; therefore they will contain equal angles. \inprop[prop:XI.X]

$\therefore \drawAngle{ABH} =  \drawAngle{DCF}$.

And, since the two sides \drawUnitLine{AB}, \drawUnitLine{BH} are equal to the two sides \drawUnitLine{DC}, \drawUnitLine{CF} \inprop[prop:I.XXXIV], and $\drawAngle{ABH} =  \drawAngle{DCF}$, $\therefore \drawUnitLine{AH} = \drawUnitLine{DF}$, and the triangle \drawLine{AB,BH,HA} is equal to the triangle \drawLine{DC,CF,FD}. \inprop[prop:I.IV]

And the parallelogram \planeAH\ is double of the triangle \drawLine{AB,BH,HA}, and the parallelogram \planeDF\ double of the triangle \drawLine{DC,CF,FD}. \inprop[prop:I.XXXIV]

$\therefore \planeAH\ =  \planeDF$.

Similarly we can prove that $\planeAC\ = \planeGF$, and $\planeAE\ = \planeBF$.

\problemNP{I}{f}{a parallelepipedal solid be cut by a plane which is parallel to the opposite planes, then, as the base is to the base, so will the solid be to the solid.}

For let the parallelepipedal solid \drawPolygon[middle][solidABCD]{RUGB,GUDH',ABGE,EGH'H,HH'DC} be cut by the plane \drawPolygon[middle][planeFG]{EGUF} which is parallel to the opposite planes \drawPolygon[middle][pgAR]{ABRV}, \drawPolygon[middle][pgDH]{HH'DC}; I say that $\drawPolygon[middle][pgAF]{VFEA} : \drawPolygon[middle][pgEC]{FCHE} :: \drawPolygon[middle][solidAU]{RUGB,ABGE,EGUF} : \drawPolygon[middle][solidED]{GUDH',EGH'H,HH'DC}$.

For let \drawUnitLine{AH} be produced in each direction, let any number of straight lines whatever, \drawUnitLine{AK}, \drawUnitLine{KL}, be made equal to \drawUnitLine{AE}, and any number whatever, \drawUnitLine{HM}, \drawUnitLine{MN}, equal to \drawUnitLine{EH}; and let the parallelograms \drawPolygon[middle][pgLP]{L'PKL}, \drawPolygon[middle][pgKV]{PVAK}, \drawPolygon[middle][pgHW]{CWMH}, \drawPolygon[middle][pgMS]{WSNM} and the solids \drawPolygon[middle][solidLQ]{LOK'K,XQK'O,KK'QP}, \drawPolygon[middle][solidKR]{KK'BA,QRBK',ABRV}, \drawPolygon[middle][solidDM]{HH'IM,DYIH',MIYW}, \drawPolygon[middle][solidMT]{MIN'N,YTN'I,NN'TS} be completed.

Then, since $\drawUnitLine{LK} = \drawUnitLine{KA} = \drawUnitLine{AE}$,
$\pgLP = \pgKV = \pgAF$, $\drawPolygon[middle][pgKO]{LOK'K} = \drawPolygon[middle][pgKB]{KK'BA} = \drawPolygon[middle][pgAG]{ABGE}$, and further $\drawPolygon[middle][pgLX]{LOXL'} = \drawPolygon[middle][pgKQ]{KK'QP} = \pgAR$, for they are opposite. \inprop[prop:XI.XXIV]

For the same reason $\pgEC = \pgHW = \pgMS$, $\drawPolygon[middle][pgHG]{EGH'H} = \drawPolygon[middle][pgHI]{HH'IM} = \drawPolygon[middle][pgIN]{MIN'N}$, and further $\pgDH = \drawPolygon[middle][pgMY]{MIYW} = \drawPolygon[middle][pgNT]{NN'TS}$. 

$\therefore$ in \solidLQ, \solidKR, \solidAU three planes are equal to three planes.

But the three planes are equal to the three opposite; $\therefore \solidLQ = \solidKR = \solidAU$.

For the same reason $\solidED = \solidDM = \solidMT$.

$\therefore \drawPolygon[middle][pgLF]{L'PKL,PVAK,VFEA} : \pgAF :: \drawPolygon[middle][solidLU]{LOK'K,KK'BA,ABGE,XQK'O,QRBK',RUGB,EGUF} : \solidAU$.

For the same reason, $\drawPolygon[middle][pgNF]{FCHE,CWMH,WSNM} : \pgEC :: \drawPolygon[middle][solidNU]{EGH'H,HH'IM,MIN'N,GUDH',DYIH',YTN'I,NN'TS} : \solidED$.

And\\
if $\pgLF = \pgNF$, $\solidLU = \solidNU$;\\
if $\pgLF > \pgNF$, $\solidLU > \solidNU$;\\
if $\pgLF < \pgNF$, $\solidLU < \solidNU$.

Therefore, there being four magnitudes, the two bases \pgAF, \pgEC, and the two solids \solidAU, \solidED, equimultiples have been taken of the base \pgAF and the solid \solidAU, namely the base \pgLF and the solid \solidLU, and equimultiples of the base \pgEC and the solid \solidED, namely the base \pgNF and the solid \solidNU, and it has been proved that, if $\pgLF > \pgNF$, $\solidLU > \solidNU$, if $\pgLF = \pgNF$, $\solidLU = \solidNU$, and if $\pgLF < \pgNF$, $\solidLU < \solidNU$.

$\therefore \pgAF : \pgEC :: \solidAU :: \solidED$. \indef[def:V.V]
